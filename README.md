# VariableBitQuantization

Here are the paper and script for the variable bit quantization research. 

Note: the main script was developed to be run on Google Colab (for better / more compute than if it were running locally). The main_script.ipynb is merely the file that has been downloaded from Google Colab and was not modified to ensure local running. If trying to rerun outside of Colab, some modifications may be needed to get the program running.
